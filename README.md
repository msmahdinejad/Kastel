# Kastel Card Game

**Kastel** is a reproduction of the card game **NOX**, implemented after I completed my basic programming courses. The game can be played by 2 to 6 players, and the rules are explained in the PDF attached below.

At the time, I made a significant effort to structure the project using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles (it was my first time having a 6-line `main` function! ðŸ˜Š). I also added creative touches to enhance the gameâ€™s presentation. For instance, I had just learned about UTF-8 encoding and managed to create a beautiful opening animation for the game.

I focused on implementing a **console-based UI/UX** with a smooth gameplay experience. You can control the game using the arrow keys and the spacebar.

Building this project was a fantastic experience for me, as it helped me dive deeper into OOP concepts, discover new programming techniques, and unleash my creativity.
